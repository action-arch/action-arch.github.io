        <p>
            Welcome to my Archive network! This is updated (almost) daily and contains a bunch of info you'll most likely need.
            I try to keep it non-biased so everyone can use it as trustworthy info. Keep in mind some topics will be very vaguely
            talked about, because when you try to be non-biased you have to exclude all things that could be biased. You can't know 
            for sure!
